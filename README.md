## About the Port ##

Following the sound advice of Jason Gregory in his wonderful book, [Game Engine Architecture (3rd edition) ](https://www.gameenginebook.com/), I decided to look at Quake 2's source code. As it happens Q2 wasn't in my Steam library, but QIII was, so I looked around for a good starting point and came accros [this source](https://github.com/PJayB/Quake-III-Arena-D3D11) and decided to base my Vulkan learning efforts on it. 

I'm doing it in my spare time, and I'm learning a lot new things so I don't have a strict time-frame.

For now I have the basic skeleton of the project and rough idea how to make the port. For the most part I'll be following the D3D11 part, even though I realize it may not be the best approach.
